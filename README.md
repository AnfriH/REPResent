# REPResent

An in-terminal presentation framework written entirely within Python 3.12 (with a little help from pyvips for image processing ðŸ˜‰).

### Usage

Currently, the framework has only been tested on Linux-based systems.
The current presentation availiable is "5 Years Well Unspent", which was performed at the [October 2024 Wellington Python Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/pythonnz-wellington/events/300250678/).
The presentation slides can be viewed by executing the presentation.py file.
Slides transitions may not look correct if viewing through an IDE output.
For the best experience, view inside a 90 x 24 terminal.
